                        <p>After watching this video,I think the main purpose of the video is trying to tell us his feelings after the death of his uncle. More importanly,  in his vedio he also reflected his releationships with family. His momther did not want a gay son.Overall,in my personal view, his whole video was telling us his feelings of a gay person, and his views of his life.</p>

                        <h1>Blog2</h1>
                         
                        <p>This video we watched during class, It reflected a general social problems around us, from this video there were two groups of people playing in the game.one was a person who plays onlie game all the time and the other were a group of kids. More importantly, I think the creater was trying to reavel some serious issues in our society. For example, peole hanging on internet all the time, and they don't even contact with the outside world. The author also criticized that people should not hang on internet for long time. Becuase this issue may later become a problem of paychological illness. </p>
                         
                       
                
                
                        <h1>Blog3</h1>
                        
                        <p>From the video Chrysler 200 commercial Imported from Detroit. This video really surprise me a lot, at the beginning of the video, it refelcted some views of the obsolete Detroit, and the old industrial stage of Detroit. As we all knwon, the city Detroit was a luxuriant and prosperous during the past 30 years, but now the prospercous auto city is poor and desolate. In my personal views, I think this video used the prospercous city to symoblize the luxury of Chrysler, because the auto company Chrysler was found in this prospercous city. Moreover, Imported from Detroit in other words means that this auto company was found here, and the director used the new generation of the Chrysler 200 to contrast with the prospercous of Detroit in the past time to reflect that the prospercous was inherited from the auto city and it will never change. Lastly, the Inclusion of Eminem"Lose Yourself" in my views reveal that you could loss yourself in this new Chrysler 200, and you would forget about the desolate in Detriot.  </p>
                
                
                
                
                        <h1>Blog4</h1>
                        <p>Today, me and my group members we scheduled a time and met up on campus to talk about our next project. Accourding to our group disscussion, we talked about our majors and previous essays to find out what topic on this project works well for all of us, after some introducing we finally made located our topic on " Games". We use "Games" to be the documentary topic because in modern society, games are becoming the most famous entertainment element for teenagers. Moreover, games reflected the improvements of technology in computer science fileds, however, this big time improvements also revealed downsides for our society. Therefore, in our project, we wanted to let audience know the improvements of games and how to use the positive effects og games.</p>
                        
                
                
                        <h1>Blog5</h1>
                        <p>In this class, I just realized that technologies are very common and important in our modern life. In my personal view, WRA 110 class is a very interesting one, this class gives you opportunities to develope your interests, and let you to learn by yourself. For example, the codecamany is a very interesting progarm, it is easy to learn and use. Therefore, I would say this class is very helpful and useful.</p>
                
                
                
                        <h1>Blog6</h1>
                        <p>According the coming group project, me and my group members we finally focused our main statement and topic, in the entire project we want audience to understand and realize the downsides of games in our society. Today, becasue the developed technologies, most of game campanies make their products very attractive for comsumers. Therefore, games are becoming the most famous entertainment in the entire world.</p>

                        <p>After finished writing the formal research project, I think the formal research project is another interesting topic to talk about, because this project leads students to use the sources in University and do their research by themself. In this project, we should be focused on our majors and use genearl and simple language and ways to bulid formal knownledge in another form. Fox example, we need to explian some fromal major articles to someone who are new to this area. In my personal views, this project let us know that knownledge could build in many different ways.</p>
                
                        
                        <h1>Blog8</h1>
                        <p>While doing this video project, I personally think that this project brings us  great opportunities to develop our learning abilities in many ways, for example to develop our skills in group work, let us become independent and find resoures on campus by ourself. Firstly, work in a group means that you have to share and exchange ideas and views with the others, moreover, besides sharing ideas, as a group member we must feel that each of us have to take the responsibilities for this group. Therefore, I think that this project are really developing our skills in different ways. Overall, I think this is a very good project, and I am looking forward to see our result of the project.</p>
