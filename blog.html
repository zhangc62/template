                        <p>After watching this video,I think the main purpose of the video is trying to tell us his feelings after the death of his uncle. More importanly,  in his vedio he also reflected his releationships with family. His momther did not want a gay son.Overall,in my personal view, his whole video was telling us his feelings of a gay person, and his views of his life.
