                        <p>After watching this video,I think the main purpose of the video is trying to tell us his feelings after the death of his uncle. More importanly,  in his vedio he also reflected his releationships with family. His momther did not want a gay son.Overall,in my personal view, his whole video was telling us his feelings of a gay person, and his views of his life.</p>

                 </main>   <p>This video we watched during class, It reflected a general social problems around us, from this video there were two groups of people playing in the game.one was a person who plays onlie game all the time and the other were a group of kids. More importantly, I think the creater was trying to reavel some serious issues in our society. For example, peole hanging on internet all the time, and they don't even contact with the outside world. The author also criticized that people should not hang on internet for long time. Becuase this issue may later become a problem of paychological illness. </p>

                        <p>From the video Chrysler 200 commercial Imported from Detroit. This video really surprise me a lot, at the beginning of the video, it refelcted some views of the obsolete Detroit, and the old industrial stage of Detroit. As we all knwon, the city Detroit was a luxuriant and prosperous during the past 30 years, but now the prospercous auto city is poor and desolate. In my personal views, I think this video used the prospercous city to symoblize the luxury of Chrysler, because the auto company Chrysler was found in this prospercous city. Moreover, Imported from Detroit in other words means that this auto company was found here, and the director used the new generation of the Chrysler 200 to contrast with the prospercous of Detroit in the past time to reflect that the prospercous was inherited from the auto city and it will never change. Lastly, the Inclusion of Eminem"Lose Yourself" in my views reveal that you could loss yourself in this new Chrysler 200, and you would forget about the desolate in Detriot.  </p>
