                        <h1>Blog 1</h1>
                        <p>After watching this video,I think the main purpose of the video is trying to tell us his feelings after the death of his uncle. More importanly,  in his vedio he also reflected his releationships with family. His momther did not want a gay son.Overall,in my personal view, his whole video was telling us his feelings of a gay person, and his views of his life.

                </main>
                        <h2>Blog 2</h2>
                        
                        <p>This video we watched during class, It reflected a general social problems around us, from this video there were two groups of people playing in the game.one was a person who plays onlie game all the time and the other were a group of kids. More importantly, I think the creater was trying to reavel some serious issues in our society. For example, peole hanging on internet all the time, and they don't even contact with the outside world. The author also criticized that people should not hang on internet for long time. Becuase this issue may later become a problem of paychological illness. </p>
