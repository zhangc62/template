                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">After watching this video,I think the main purpose of the video is trying to tell us his feelings after the death of his uncle. More importanly,  in his vedio he also reflected his releationships with family. His momther did not want a gay son.Overall,in my personal view, his whole video was telling us his feelings of a gay person, and his views of his life.</p>

                        <h1>Blog2</h1>
                         
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">This video we watched during class, It reflected a general social problems around us, from this video there were two groups of people playing in the game.one was a person who plays onlie game all the time and the other were a group of kids. More importantly, I think the creater was trying to reavel some serious issues in our society. For example, peole hanging on internet all the time, and they don't even contact with the outside world. The author also criticized that people should not hang on internet for long time. Becuase this issue may later become a problem of paychological illness. </p>
                         
                       
                
                
                        <h1>Blog3</h1>
                        
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">From the video Chrysler 200 commercial Imported from Detroit. This video really surprise me a lot, at the beginning of the video, it refelcted some views of the obsolete Detroit, and the old industrial stage of Detroit. As we all knwon, the city Detroit was a luxuriant and prosperous during the past 30 years, but now the prospercous auto city is poor and desolate. In my personal views, I think this video used the prospercous city to symoblize the luxury of Chrysler, because the auto company Chrysler was found in this prospercous city. Moreover, Imported from Detroit in other words means that this auto company was found here, and the director used the new generation of the Chrysler 200 to contrast with the prospercous of Detroit in the past time to reflect that the prospercous was inherited from the auto city and it will never change. Lastly, the Inclusion of Eminem"Lose Yourself" in my views reveal that you could loss yourself in this new Chrysler 200, and you would forget about the desolate in Detriot.  </p>
                
                
                
                
                        <h1>Blog4</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Today, me and my group members we scheduled a time and met up on campus to talk about our next project. Accourding to our group disscussion, we talked about our majors and previous essays to find out what topic on this project works well for all of us, after some introducing we finally made located our topic on " Games". We use "Games" to be the documentary topic because in modern society, games are becoming the most famous entertainment element for teenagers. Moreover, games reflected the improvements of technology in computer science fileds, however, this big time improvements also revealed downsides for our society. Therefore, in our project, we wanted to let audience know the improvements of games and how to use the positive effects og games.</p>
                        
                
                
                        <h1>Blog5</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In this class, I just realized that technologies are very common and important in our modern life. In my personal view, WRA 110 class is a very interesting one, this class gives you opportunities to develope your interests, and let you to learn by yourself. For example, the codecamany is a very interesting progarm, it is easy to learn and use. Therefore, I would say this class is very helpful and useful.</p>
                
                
                
                        <h1>Blog6</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">According the coming group project, me and my group members we finally focused our main statement and topic, in the entire project we want audience to understand and realize the downsides of games in our society. Today, becasue the developed technologies, most of game campanies make their products very attractive for comsumers. Therefore, games are becoming the most famous entertainment in the entire world.</p>
                
                
                
                        <h1>Blog7</h1>
                       
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">After finished writing the formal research project, I think the formal research project is another interesting topic to talk about, because this project leads students to use the sources in University and do their research by themself. In this project, we should be focused on our majors and use genearl and simple language and ways to bulid formal knownledge in another form. Fox example, we need to explian some fromal major articles to someone who are new to this area. In my personal views, this project let us know that knownledge could build in many different ways.</p>
                
                        
                        <h1>Blog8</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">While doing this video project, I personally think that this project brings us  great opportunities to develop our learning abilities in many ways, for example to develop our skills in group work, let us become independent and find resoures on campus by ourself. Firstly, work in a group means that you have to share and exchange ideas and views with the others, moreover, besides sharing ideas, as a group member we must feel that each of us have to take the responsibilities for this group. Therefore, I think that this project are really developing our skills in different ways. Overall, I think this is a very good project, and I am looking forward to see our result of the project.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h1>Blog9</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Right now it is almost the end of this school year, however, when I lookback into our first project I just realized something differently from the begining of the semester. At the beginning of the year,when I read the assignment I just felt like we have to introduce our major and tell readers something new in our career fildes. However, at the end of the yaer, I just realized that this project wasnt that simple, in my new views, I think this project was asking us to think carefully and detially about our major,and why this major should be your career fileds and what special parts would you introduce when people ask about your major.</P>
                        
                        <h1>Blog10</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">It's almost the end of this semester, when I looked back to this year I just realized that I learned a lot from this WRA110 class. After this semester with Dr. Daniels I think my writing skills has improved a lot than before. Before taking this class, I thought that WRA110 would be a hard class and we have to deal with ton of essays everyday. However, when I first time take this hybrid writing class, I just realized that this class gives students opportunities to learn and write by themselves. Moreover, this writing class also related with computer science and some HTML knowledge we never learned before. Therefore, it’s been a great semester with Dr. Daniels and I really enjoyed and learned many new skills in my life.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog11</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Most of students would think that this is a hybrid writing class, and they wouldn’t need to be very busy. In the contrary, if you want to do well in this class, you have to follow the schedule very well and you really can’t get behind. In my views, the hybrid class gives students more time to learn and explore by themselves, for example, the formal research project, we need to find resources by ourselves, and use those resources to find out how knowledge could build into different ways. Therefore, I would encourage new college students take this writing class instead of others. Because this WRA110 class did not only teach you how to write, but it also teach you how modern technology are related with writing. </p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog12</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">After shooting the video project, I found that our group did a good job on this project, however, there are some issues we still need to fix. For example,most of our interviewees didn’t want to be filmed in video; moreover, the technology is another part of issues, when we were filming the interview, it was hard to get start with their action in the same time, and this issue made us to rework and restart the camera very often. After this project, we actually learned a lot, if we have another chance to work on this project, we would make improvements in many parts. For example, when shooting a video, we would click the start bottom for at least five seconds and they let interviewees start to talk. Therefore, we wouldn’t lose any moments and actions. Furthermore, next time we would also let interviewees to get more time to prepare and get comfortable for the interview.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog13</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Our process and planning of the Remix Project Assessment Memo, For instance, In this Multimedia Remix Project, we are focusing on a type of social issue in our daily life. For example, health issues, fast food in America, and the expensive of textbooks. However, after meeting with my group members, we finally deiced that doing a documentary project of “games” would be a best topic and way for us. There are various reasons to explain why this topic would be the best way to use on this documentary project. Firstly, two of our group members are major in computer science and they have batter views of computers and games. Secondly, most of people in our social circles are game lovers, and more than 40% of them would spend more than two hours to play games everyday. Therefore, we have many people could invite to this interview and talk about their views and feelings of playing games. More importantly, games are becoming a very popular entertainment event for all ages of people. However, games not only create advantages for people, but they also reflect more social issues. Such as, people spend more time on playing games, and video games caused health problems. Therefore, we realized that we have more things and information to talk about for this documentary project and this would be the right topic for our group.</p>
                
                
                        <h1>Blog14</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">My personal views of the formal research project,we could tell that in a same discipline, knowledge could really build in different ways, in the trade publication article, the author uses general and common words and language to explain the complex chemistry knowledge, however, in the formal scholar article, the author uses a large amount of formal and academic words to explain the experiments and theories. It was difficult to understand to someone who is new to this filed even after analyzing. Overall, I personally prefer the “informal” way of building knowledge, because this way are very easy to understand and easy to attract readers who are need to this knowledge.  </p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog15</h1>
                        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">At the end of this semester, I really learned and enjored this class, and of course I learned new things from each of the four projects.The most interesting and important project of this class I think it’s the formal research project, although it was the most hard essay to write in the entire semester. In my personal views, this project was designed to develop students’ self-learning skills and skills of use resources on campus. In this project, as a chemistry major student, I have to find one formal research article about chemistry fields and another informal article about chemistry. After that my job was to compare the differences between these two types of articles and point out why there are such huge difference and explain are these difference have some effect or influence to readers. More importantly, I have to use translate those formal words languages and concepts in chemistry fields to general and simple ways to people who are new to this area. When I look back to this project right now, I almost forget about the pain and difficulties of this project, but what I gained was the process of using campus resources and the understanding of building knowledge in different ways. Therefore, I would say the formal research project was the most interesting and meaningful project in this class.</p>
