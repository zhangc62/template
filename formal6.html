			<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">For example, Egg Tempera Paint, this type of painting method was used during fourteenth century in Europe. The Egg Tempera Paint use egg and water to mix with pigments. The paint is applied layer upon layer; it creates a luminous and bright quality unlike any other paint in the fourteenth century. The Egg Tempera Paint unlike other paint, it’s very easy to clean up, and it’s water soluble when wet, more importantly, this kind of new painting style has excellent effects for detail work, therefore, it reflects some unique results than other paintings in the fourteenth. 
According to the Egg Tempera Paint, the most important advantage is that this kind of paint could keep its colors and quality until today, because the wet plaster has a high ability of absorption, and the pigments were absorbed into spread wet plaster and kept vibrant and fresh as long as the plaster survived and the paint became part of the plaster. Therefore, today most of famous fresco paintings of the Italian Renaissance, such as the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel ceiling painted by Michelangelo still reflect the beauty today. 
According to another paint fund in the current hundred of years, the Acrylic paint. Acrylic paint is made from some colored organic molecules in water. This type new paints dry quickly than others, and they are also very durable and sustained. Acrylic paint is easy to use and control for any artist. Moreover, acrylic paints are soluble in water, thus they can be dilute with water, and paintbrushes can easily be cleaned with water. In painting, the best thing is that if an artist makes a mistake, acrylic paints can be painted over and over and hides the mistake again and again, therefore no one knows there was a mistake on the painting. For instance, David Alfara Sequeiros, he was a Mexican artist, he was one of the first person to use acrylic paint to work on his art. Acrylic paint consists of colored thermoplastic resins suspended in water. In the 1930s chemists were experimenting with long-chain organic molecules. When a colored molecule appeared, it was logical to consider the use of the molecule as a pigment in a synthetic paint. Contemporary artists worldwide rapidly embraced acrylic paint for art expression. It dries quickly and is durable, brightly colored, and easily controlled by the artist.
Another example reflects a new reversible technology, which is how to convert wasted carbon dioxide to working carbon dioxide. Generally, carbon dioxide in today become to the most of the attention for scientists and technologists to deal with its potential as a useful source of carbon. This example reveals some methods to convert wasted carbon dioxide to benefit substances in chemistry, and it also shows the analysis of some potential applications, which enable the wasted gases into working gases. 
It is very obvious that today our nature is not able to reduce anthropogenic (wasted gases made by people) carbon dioxide anymore, although only to a few percent of the total amount of carbon dioxide involved in the natural cycle. Therefore, we must have to find a new way to reduce the total volume of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
In fact, nowadays based on the growth of population and the increase of energy consumption, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and some other wasted gases are causing some serious concerns about the climate change of our planet and such issues may generate extreme, and even become to some uncontrollable events. Therefore, scientists and new technologists much start finding a way to convert wasted carbon dioxide to working energy in order to reduce the high concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere or even reduce it to lower values, reduce it lower as agreed at the international level. The capture of CO2 from point, continuous sources (mainly power stations) are under assessment as a technology, which may avoid CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Power stations are the most abundant continuous point source of CO2, but they are not the only one to use as consideration. 
Recovery and utilization of carbon dioxide is a well known technology since the end of the 1800s. In fact, in 1869, the synthesis of salicylic acid was made from phenol salts (Na and K) and CO2.
In 1882, the Solvay process for the synthesis of NaHCO3–Na2CO3 was Developed CaCO3→CaO+CO2 NaCl+NH3+CO2+H2O→NaHCO3+NH4Cl, 2NaHCO3→Na2CO3+CO2+H2O
2NH4Cl+CaO→CaCl2+2NH3+H2O
    In this process, carbon dioxide is produced by thermal dissolution of CaCO3 to afford CaO. However, this was the first industrial process of wasted gases in the world, which there was a recovery and recycle of by-products: both CO2 and NH3 were recovered and reused.
   Many years later, the conversion of ammonia and carbon dioxide into urea was achieved in 1922 (CO2+2NH3→H2NCONH2+H2O). Since the perverse achievements on wasted gases conversion, these kinds of processes become the only way to reduce aforementioned products, such as carbon dioxide.
