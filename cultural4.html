			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>For instance, They build their factories in third world countries, they produce more items, they also release more wasted elements, more importantly, some of the international companies let young worker work on a big amount of labor hours a day. Nike build most of their companies in third world countries, and the popular of the sneaker culture could result of environmental issues. Because the expensive labor fees in the United States, Nike build most of their main factories in Asian countries, they utilized their world countries’ cheap labors, natural recourses, and landscapes to produce their countless products. More people joined the sneaker game mean more people are buying shoes, more people are buying shoes reflect more shoes are producing, and more shoes are producing reveal more wasted and toxic element are polluting to our environment. Therefore, this entire sneaker chain already became a vicious circle, every time when people line up and go crazy for buying a pair of limited shoes, they are actually support the shoe companies to produce more shoes and pollute more wasted and toxic elements in the third world countries. 
In the sneaker culture, people tended to buy sneakers without logical thinking; they would buy up at anywhere if shoe companies releases limited editions or some rare color ways. Therefore, buyer’s purchasing power stimulates the rates of productivities, and behind this entire cycle, natural recourses were wasted, toxic element was produced and our environment was polluted. According to some research, in the pasted three decades, one third of our natural recourses spaces had been consumed. Commences are taking over and cutting the natural paces so fast, in the third world counties, part of their landscapes has been taken to build factories, most of their recourse, energy has been used to make products. In the end, people in their world only deserved a small amount of money, and a polluted landscape.</p>
