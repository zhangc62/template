		<h1>The importance of chemistry in different fields</h1>
		<p>  In modern world, you wouldn’t be unfamiliar if you heard something about “Economy”, because every day and even every year, you would see a countless of economic elements in your every day lives. For example, you would see GDP on newspaper, you would realize people talk about economics on TV all the time, and moreover, the major economics is becoming to one of the most famous majors in the entire world. However, science is also a very important role in our life, but people just didn’t notice that. 


 


</p>
		<p>  I am a Chemistry major student at Michigan State University. However, I wasn’t interested in scientific stuff before two things appeared in my life. Since I was little, I always heard parents mentioned about a kind of herbal medicine tea, and once a time I coughed very hard, they let me to drink the tea to reduce the illness, the next day I felt better and didn’t cough any more. After that, I just felt curious why the herbal medicine tea could get the illness away? Later, I grow older, based on a few sciences knowledge, I realized those tea were actually contained medicine elements, and medicines could make people feel better. When I went to middle school, I had an opportunity to visit a pharmaceutical industry, and this visit let me realized I had a strong curiousness in science and chemistry fields. During the visit, many high technology devises that used in chemistry fields were very interesting, for instance, reactor, magnetic stirrer, but there was one machine attracted my attention, this machine was called HPLC, which stands for High-performance liquid chromatography. This types of machine are wildly used in our lives, for example HPLC has been used for food factories, it detecting vitamin C levels in orange juice, legal, it detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine, manufacturing, it detecting during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products, and this device is even helpful for police departments, it could find out any details from a crime scene. The machine, HPLC it relies on special pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out the column. That’s how does HLPC work. In the visit, an instructor used a cup of orange juice as sample to show me how does HPLC work. He simply just set up the machine and added a small volume of the sample into HPLC, after few minutes a graph released on a screen, and those different curves were represent different molecule and component members. From the result, most of them were water, sugar, vitamins and impurity. This simple experiment just answered my question from the past, why did I feel better after drinking a cup of herbal medicine tea. I was shocked because I just realized that chemical elements are just lived around us but we just didn’t realize that. I finally felt my strong interests in chemistry; because most of chemical things are invisible, we need to explore what is inside of the substance. Therefore, I deiced to choose chemistry as my major because I had strong curiousness of science when I was little and, I think chemistry and many high technology devices are very important and useful in our life. But today, many non-chemistry major people think that they won’t deal with chemistry any more after they finish high school or stander college requirements. In fact, chemistry plays a very important role in our daily life and our surroundings. For example, food, make ups, and drugs. </p>
	        <p>  For example, food, food is the number one supplements to support our body and provide energy and vitamins to let us keep healthy. In modern time, our life gets much better than before, people now have verity choice of food to eat every day.  However, for some people who have less knowledge of chemistry, they might ignore the importance of food supplements. They don’t know what kind of food or vitamins are benefit for human bodies and what type of vitamins they need to supply if they have some illness. Food could make us become healthy because foods are composed by millions of molecules, and those chemistry elements formed millions of molecules. Therefore, every time when people eat food, they are actually eating chemistry elements, and more importantly the entire world is made of chemistry elements. That is why learn some general chemistry knowledge is important and useful for human beings. </p>
	
		<p>  More than that, we could also tell the importance of food supplements from ethnic group between Asians and Europeans. Most of time, when you see a Europeans person, he/she may look taller or stronger than an Asian person. Besides environmental and geographical factors, genes caused the main reasons of why these two types of people look different, and the differences of genes are relate with food supplements. In Europe, people eat beef, cheese, and eggs more often than people in Asia. As we known, those foods contain more proteins and calcium than others. Proteins and calcium are the main factors to determine a person’s physique. Thus, food is important supplements to support our body, food provide energy and vitamins to let us keep healthy.</p>
                <p>  Except a healthy life, knowing some general chemistry knowledge could also help us to avoid some dangerous situations and save our lives. For example, sleeping in a car with heat turned on may caused serious danger. Many people sleep in cars when they feel tried, and in winter they would turn heat on to keep them stay warm. In the contrary, they actually put themselves in danger. Before they getting sleepy, they won’t feel any thing uncomfortable. However, when they turned on heat while sleeping for a long time, some wasted gas from engine would come inside through the heat system, and most of wasted gases contains CO (carbon monoxide), and CO2 (carbon dioxide). In the wasted gases, the main harmful gas, carbon monoxide consists one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, connected by a triple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent bond. It is a kind of toxic gas to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations. Therefore when people sleep in the cars, they would respire big amount carbon monoxides in side their body, moreover, higher concentrations of carbon monoxides would recede the ability of hemoglobin to supply oxygen to our body, eventually, carbon monoxides would cause headache, dizziness and even death, consequently, its better to know some basic chemistry knowledge to keep us safe.</p>
                <p>  In short, our nature and the entire environment are built on organic elements, they might not appear in our daily lives, and some non-science major people might don’t care about chemistry any more after they finish high school or stander college requirements. In fact that organic substances are playing in many important roles in our surroundings. They control our body; they can cause benefits results, and reduce pernicious problems. Therefore, my strong interests of chemistry lead me to choose chemistry as my career path, because the variety of chemical fields are mysterious, and there are still many undiscovered fields we need to explore. </p>
