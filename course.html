		<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">My Experiences of the First Year College Writing Class </h1>
		
		<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">After this semester with Dr. Daniels, I think my writing skills have improved a lot than before. Before taking this class, I heard from other students and they told me that WRA110 is a hard class and you basically just write your papers every week. Therefore, in my personal view, I thought that WRA110 would be some challenges for me, and I have to deal with ton of essays in this class. However, when I first walked into this class and took this hybrid-writing lecture, I just realized that this class was designed to give students lots of opportunities to learn and write by themselves. More importantly, this writing class also related with computer science and some HTML knowledge I never learned before. Thus, I think I really enjoyed in this year and learned useful skills from this class. Overall it’s been a great semester with Dr. Daniels and I would suggest new college students to take this class, because you will realize that this class is very open and diverse on learning. Such as, codecademy, github, and finally the design of your own profile page. </p>

                <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Before talking about four major projects in this course, I want to mention about codecademy, because those this online program actually helped me a lot on the later projects. The codecademy is an online self-learning program; in this program students could pick any topics related with computer science major. According to this class, we have to put our essays and projects on our website and the codecademy program gives us opportunities to learn and design our own web page style by ourselves.</p>

		<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">At the beginning of the semester, our first project was dealing with lived experiences, in other words, we are writing about our major or future career fields. In this project, I am writing about my major chemistry, besides introduce to others about my major, this project also let me think deeply what is good about my future career. In my essay I reflected that chemistry is not an only subject in college, but it’s also a king of general knowledge in our daily lives. Because, chemistry stuff related with your health problems, and fast food could cause some serious social issues today. More importantly, almost every single thing around us is dealing with chemistry, cars, paints, and oils; therefore, this project really let me think deeply and wildly about chemistry major. Now I realized that thinking deeply and wildly are really helpful when you writing a paper, when I reread and looked back into my essay, I could tell that this project really let me to explore and detect why I would choose chemistry as my future career.  </p>
	       
	        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Furthermore, the third project of this class, or I would say this is the most interesting and important project of this class in my point of view, the formal research project. Because many different academic disciplines have their different ways of explaining and analyzing information, and various ways of building knowledge, thus this formal report gives students the opportunity to begin building their own understanding of two types of articles and analyze the differences between these two articles, moreover, at the end, students also need to translate both articles to general language and words to someone who are need to this area. Besides analyzing the different ways of building knowledge, this project also mainly develops students’ ability of learning and using on campus recourses. For example, there are two types of articles from a same discipline, and each of them tells some knowledge in their own ways, then students will read and analyze the differences of those two. In my essay, I used one formal article called “Art in Chemistry” and another informal article called  “Chemistry of art” to compare and analyze how are these two different. </p>
	
		<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In this project, as a chemistry major student, I have to find one formal research article about chemistry fields and another informal article about chemistry. After that my job was to compare the differences between these two types of articles and point out why there are such huge difference and explain are these difference have some effect or influence to readers. More importantly, I have to use translate those formal words languages and concepts in chemistry fields to general and simple ways to people who are new to this area. When I look back to this project right now, I almost forget about the pain and difficulties of this project, but what I gained was the process of using campus resources and the understanding of building knowledge in different ways. Therefore, I would say the formal research project was the most interesting and meaningful project in this class. </p>
                
                <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Finally, our fourth and last project was called remix video project, this project was designed for college students to learn and understand the importance of teamwork and learn how to share ideas and statements with others. More importantly, it also let students to interview people from diverse background in order to make the video more convincible for audiences. In this Multimedia Remix Project, professor Daniels asked us to focus on a type of social issues in our daily life, and transfer all of our ideas and statements into a documentary video. For example, health issues, fast food in America, and the expensive of textbooks, all of them are really good topics to use in this project. Moreover, the requirements of this video project would be around 7 to 9 minutes long, and professor Daniels encouraged students to use more emotional words, and languages in order to convince your audiences and make your video more interesting. </p>
                
                <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;"> In our group meeting, we shared different ideas from different group members; I could tell that different people have their different views on this project, every time when others shared and reflected their ideas, I would always asked myself why and how would he thought of those great points, and then I also encouraged myself to think whatever I want, and think wieldy in my mind. Besides thinking, and sharing ideas, working on camera and other devices were also a meaningful lecture for my group members and myself. When I looked back to my entire process of this video project today, I concluded some advices for next year students, for instance, before you doing this video project, I strongly suggest that your group members and you think widely about what is the best topic to pick in this video. Because once you find the right topic, then your entire video process shouldn’t be difficult. For example, in my group, we were focusing on game issues, we pick this topic because two of our group members were major in computer science and they have better views of computers and games. Secondly, most of people in our social circles are game lovers, and more than 40% of them would spend more than two hours to play games everyday. Therefore, we have many people could be our recourse and invite to this interview and talk about their views and feelings of playing games.</p>
	        
	        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">The Second important thing in this group project is commutation, talk to your group members and share your ideas with others. Sharing ideas and commutations are very important in this project, if the commutations and cooperation don’t work very well in your group, then it’s very difficult to keep your members work together on this project.</p>
		
		<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Lastly, there are many challenging problems you will find out during the process of the project. In my case, when we were filming the interview, it was hard to get start with other members’ actions in the same time, and this issue made us to rework and restart the camera very often. After this project, we actually learned a lot, if we have another chance to work on this project, we would make improvements in many parts. For example, when shooting a video, we would click the start bottom of the camera for at least five seconds and they let interviewees start to talk. Thus, we wouldn’t lose any moments and actions. Overall, after this semester, my writing skills have improved a lot than before, and I also had a better view of HTML code and how to write simple code by myself. </p>
		
		<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In short, I really learned and enjoyed a lot from this class. Most of students would think that this is a hybrid writing class, and they wouldn’t need to be very busy. In the contrary, if you want to do well in this class, you have to follow the schedule very well and you really can’t get behind. In my views, the hybrid class gives students more time to learn and explore by themselves, for example, the formal research project, we need to find resources by ourselves, and use those resources to find out how knowledge could build into different ways. Therefore, I would encourage new college students take this writing class instead of others. Because this WRA110 class did not only teach you how to write, but it also teach you how modern technology are related with writing.</p>
