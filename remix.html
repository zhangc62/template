	        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In this Multimedia Remix Project, we are focusing on a type of social issue in our daily life. For example, health issues, fast food in America, and the expensive of textbooks. However, after meeting with my group members, we finally deiced that doing a documentary project of “games” would be a best topic and way for us. There are various reasons to explain why this topic would be the best way to use on this documentary project. Firstly, two of our group members are major in computer science and they have batter views of computers and games. Secondly, most of people in our social circles are game lovers, and more than 40% of them would spend more than two hours to play games everyday. Therefore, we have many people could invite to this interview and talk about their views and feelings of playing games. More importantly, games are becoming a very popular entertainment event for all ages of people. However, games not only create advantages for people, but they also reflect more social issues. Such as, people spend more time on playing games, and video games caused health problems. Therefore, we realized that we have more things and information to talk about for this documentary project and this would be the right topic for our group.</p> 

                <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">During the process of this project, we thought this project wouldn’t be very difficult because we have many resources and information to reflect in this project. In the contrary, we finally realized there are more challenging issues we had to deal with. For example, most of our interviewees didn’t want to be filmed in video; moreover, the technology is another part of issues, when we were filming the interview, it was hard to get start with their action in the same time, and this issue made us to rework and restart the camera very often. After this project, we actually learned a lot, if we have another chance to work on this project, we would make improvements in many parts. For example, when shooting a video, we would click the start bottom for at least five seconds and they let interviewees start to talk. Therefore, we wouldn’t lose any moments and actions. Furthermore, next time we would also let interviewees to get more time to prepare and get comfortable for the interview. According to this project, there were many resources made contributions to our project. For example, most of audience would think that there are more downsides of playing games than benefits of games, because “ games” already made some social issues to teenagers. However, students in our interview reflect their views of the issues of playing games. They stated that self-control is the most important thing for game lovers, if they understand games are just for fun and relax, if game lovers understand the downsides of playing games, and understand the importance of self-control, then there wouldn’t be a problem of playing games.</p>
 
                <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Furthermore, the least benefit of the resources would be the reasons of playing games; most of our interviewee explained the reason quite simple and limited. I think they should think deeply and carefully why are they playing games and what could games influence them.</p>
	
	        <p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">Lastly, this video project was very helpful and meaningful; the entire collaboration was very fruitful. Each of our group members was on their role of doing this project. We met up on campus during weekends and talk about our ideas and plans of how to complete this project, and then we scheduled another time at dorm and filmed the video and finally created this project. </p>
