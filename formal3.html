			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Nowadays, colors and paints are very often to notice in our lives, almost everything are painted with different colors, an object without paint just like a person without clothes. However, most people probably don’t realize that paint is type of chemistry substances in our surroundings. A study reveals that our ancestors learned to paint from the ancient period. For example, the ancient painting found in caves and walls were made from plants, animal body parts, and inorganics such as minerals. Moreover, from the Yuan dynastic in Mongolia people found that ground cobalt painted on clay turned blue when fired. Therefore, paint is one of the oldest chemical substances in the nature.In another formal scholar article, we are going to experience how to use carbon dioxide as a useful source in chemistry. As we known, carbon dioxide is one of the wastes gas in modern nature, as economic growth, and new technologies developed, our life are getting better and better. More cars driving on roads, and more factories are producing items to make the growth of GDP. In the contrary, more resources are wasted in recent years, and more carbon dioxide is released to our environment and nature. According to a formal research, in these few years of the world, people are using the discovery of available petroleum sources and the development of new technologies for our energy recovery and saving, although those methods still have some negative influences to environment. However, if we still continue to spend and waste the limited amount of natural source and ceaselessly released carbon substances to our nature, we will not only lead to some serious climate changes, but also exhaust our nature source of chemical carbon. According to a phase “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Therefore, people must need to find other methods to reduce the current resource consumption.</p>
