			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Therefore, in my personal views, I don’t mind people buying nice shoes, but I am against that people buying sneakers without logic. Because today the issue what we are facing are not just we using too much stuff, but we are producing and using more than necessaries. In order to protect our natural environment and our resources, we must find some solutions to avoid this type of social issues; therefore, we must start thinking about why are we buying all these useless products. 
The general solution to stop being materialism and being reason when spend your money, is to build a stable inner world of yourself. Spirituality, relationships, education, learning, reasoning are all factors of this inner wall. In this inner wall, you have to think from different sides, for example, when you purchase a pair of shoes, besides enjoying your new collection, but also think about the story behind this product, think about the worker who made these, think about how many materials were used into these shoes. When a person with a strong inner world, their beliefs won’t be confused by buying more products or attracted by luxury items. However how do you build this inner wall to keep you out of the consumerism? In my view, I just simply believed that learning and understanding are the best way to build your inner wall. Learn more knowledge and improve your understanding could avoid you from buying things randomly and could solve some types of social issues. For example, if you know the industry chain well enough you would probably care about people who live in the third world, furthermore, if you have been learned some science knowledge, you may understand and realized the horrible consequence of environmental pollutions.
