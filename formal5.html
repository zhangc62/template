			<p>In general speaking, paint is a kind of liquid with different colors that you could put on a surface, but in chemistry paint is a solution, suspension, or a colloid made up of a colored pigment and this kind of pigment could put on a surface and protect the object. For instance, cars are painted on pigments to avoid rust; clothes are painted on different pigments to create the beauty of fashions. Therefore, paint is used for many reasons, not only to make objects attractive and emotional, but also protect the surface of objects. 
Paint can be made from two major elements; pigment and binder, but there are some other additives are often found in paint, such as metallic salts, glycerin (a kind of oil from plants) and odorants (something gives the paint a kind of smell). Over all, all paint are considered as solutions. Solutions include in two parts, a solute and a solvent. In paint, pigment is the solute and binder is the solvent. Generally, scientists considered all paints as a group of solutions and called them homogeneous mixtures, which means a mixture that is uniform throughout. Many paints are colloidal solutions, in other words the pigment particles should be something around 1 to 1,000 nanometers in size. Therefore these particles would keep the colloidal status all the time, they do not come together and become to larger particles because they against each other.
Chemistry makes different types of paint to provide different features in art, such as, Egg Tempera Paint, watercolor, and Oil Paint, they are all paints, they all create beauties, but each of them create a unique characteristic on different objects. 
The current studies and uses of carbon dioxide for chemical synthesis (it’s a combination or a mixture) are very limited; the major industrial processes mainly produce the synthesis of urea (“urea is an organic compound with the chemical formula CO (NH2) The molecule has two —NH2 groups joined by a carbonyl (C=O) functional group”), salicylic acid, methanol, and inorganic carbonates. However, in recent years, “Asahi Kasei” Corporation finally found out a sizable quantity of carbon dioxide is utilized in a greener synthesis, which means it avoids the use of the very toxic phosgene (a type of toxic gas) reagent.</p>
