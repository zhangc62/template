			<p>In general speaking, paint is a kind of liquid with different colors that you could put on a surface, but in chemistry paint is a solution, suspension, or a colloid made up of a colored pigment and this kind of pigment could put on a surface and protect the object. For instance, cars are painted on pigments to avoid rust; clothes are painted on different pigments to create the beauty of fashions. Therefore, paint is used for many reasons, not only to make objects attractive and emotional, but also protect the surface of objects. 
Paint can be made from two major elements; pigment and binder, but there are some other additives are often found in paint, such as metallic salts, glycerin (a kind of oil from plants) and odorants (something gives the paint a kind of smell). Over all, all paint are considered as solutions. Solutions include in two parts, a solute and a solvent. In paint, pigment is the solute and binder is the solvent. Generally, scientists considered all paints as a group of solutions and called them homogeneous mixtures, which means a mixture that is uniform throughout. Many paints are colloidal solutions, in other words the pigment particles should be something around 1 to 1,000 nanometers in size. Therefore these particles would keep the colloidal status all the time, they do not come together and become to larger particles because they against each other.
Chemistry makes different types of paint to provide different features in art, such as, Egg Tempera Paint, watercolor, and Oil Paint, they are all paints, they all create beauties, but each of them create a unique characteristic on different objects. 
For example, Egg Tempera Paint, this type of painting method was used during fourteenth century in Europe. The Egg Tempera Paint use egg and water to mix with pigments. The paint is applied layer upon layer; it creates a luminous and bright quality unlike any other paint in the fourteenth century. The Egg Tempera Paint unlike other paint, it’s very easy to clean up, and it’s water soluble when wet, more importantly, this kind of new painting style has excellent effects for detail work, therefore, it reflects some unique results than other paintings in the fourteenth. 
According to the Egg Tempera Paint, the most important advantage is that this kind of paint could keep its colors and quality until today, because the wet plaster has a high ability of absorption, and the pigments were absorbed into spread wet plaster and kept vibrant and fresh as long as the plaster survived and the paint became part of the plaster. Therefore, today most of famous fresco paintings of the Italian Renaissance, such as the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel ceiling painted by Michelangelo still reflect the beauty today. 
According to another paint fund in the current hundred of years, the Acrylic paint. Acrylic paint is made from some colored organic molecules in water. This type new paints dry quickly than others, and they are also very durable and sustained. Acrylic paint is easy to use and control for any artist. Moreover, acrylic paints are soluble in water, thus they can be dilute with water, and paintbrushes can easily be cleaned with water. In painting, the best thing is that if an artist makes a mistake, acrylic paints can be painted over and over and hides the mistake again and again, therefore no one knows there was a mistake on the painting. For instance, David Alfara Sequeiros, he was a Mexican artist, he was one of the first person to use acrylic paint to work on his art. Acrylic paint consists of colored thermoplastic resins suspended in water. In the 1930s chemists were experimenting with long-chain organic molecules. When a colored molecule appeared, it was logical to consider the use of the molecule as a pigment in a synthetic paint. Contemporary artists worldwide rapidly embraced acrylic paint for art expression. It dries quickly and is durable, brightly colored, and easily controlled by the artist.
