			<p>Today “Sneakerhead” is a group of people who collect limited, rare or some other limited sneakers. The name “ sneakerhead ” came out in the late 1980s in the U.S and this culture could be attributed by two major events: basketball and hip hop music. In the late 1980s, Michael Jordan leaded basketball became the most famous sport in the United States, because of his skills and basketball intelligent, he pushed NBA became very commercialized in the late 1980s. In that time, because the famous of Michael Jordan, and the popular of the basketball association. An American sports goods company Nike Sports captured this great business opportunity to sell their products and let them finally became a large international company all over the world. Back into 1980s, Nike started to design and make Jordan’s first pair high technology basketball shoes, and they referred these pair of shoes as Air Jordan I. When the air Jordan I first opened to public, many young people were attracted by the fresh design and the vivid color way. After Nike’s first opening of the sneakerhead culture, they later became to the most famous sports company in the United States, almost every child; every teenager would ask their parents to buy them a pair of Nike shoes. More importantly, Nike utilized the advantages of sneakerheads and sneaker culture, they started to sign contract and make more basketball shoes for some particular NBA stars. In recent years, Nike signed more than 200 basketball players in NBA, for example, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Durant. In order to expand the number of sneakerheads and spread the sneaker culture to the entire world. In 2010, Nike started to increase the numbers of shoes, which they design for NBA super stars, and they also started to release Air Jordan retro (Nike reproduce a series of basketball shoes that Nike designed for Michael Jordan in the past years). After the releasing in 2010, more people were attracted by those fancy basketball shoes and started to become one of the sneakerheads, In Asia, Europe, and America, people lined up out side of stores and wait to buy a pair of the limited shoes, however not every one is lucky enough to get chance to buy the shoes. Many of them, waited out side of footlockers for eight hours to buy the limited shoes, and some of them paid higher price to buy the shoes from other resellers. In short, sneakerheads were totally controlled by the sneaker culture and shoe companies. Every pairs of limited shoes are very popular and those would sell out immediately after the releasing. 
More than that, in order to attract more buyers, Nike started to produce several color ways for one model of shoes. For example, five years ago, when the sneakerhead populations wasn’t a large amount of people, Nike only released six color ways for Kobe Bryant’s basketball shoes, however, today, Nike totally released more than ten color ways for Kobe in a year, besides the regular edition they also released many limited editions to fascinate sneakerheads to buy their shoes. Therefore, people could not stop from buying sneakers, and this sneaker game is going to expand larger and larger. The sneaker game are becoming popular in anywhere of the world, however, this sneaker cultural artifact are also bringing some influence in the negative side</p>
