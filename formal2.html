			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In modern, Chemistry is a widely used discipline in all over the world, because our nature and the entire environment system are built on organic elements, and these elements may not appear in our daily lives very often, however, the organic substances are playing in many important roles in our surroundings. For example, food, drugs, medicines, all of them are dealing with chemistry; and more importantly, you probably donâ€™t know that art also deals with chemistry. According to this Formal Research project, I am going to reflect and analysis the diversity of chemistry from two articles, one from a trade publication, which talks about chemistry in art, and the other one from a formal scholar publication that deals with the use of carbon dioxide in chemistry. After analyzing these two types of articles we could tell that knowledge are building in multiple ways, and people using different languages, and forms to present a same discipline to people from different level of educations.   </p>
