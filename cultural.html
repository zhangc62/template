			<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">This article mainly talks about how people are being enslaved by consumer culture and consumerism. For example the sneaker culture, because of many commercials and celebrity effect, a lot of people went crazy of buying sneakers, especially buying from Nike, and Air Jordan. In this sneaker community, people like to show off their limited footwear therefore more people would lined up outside of stores and wait to buy a pair of the limited shoes, however not every one is lucky enough to get chance to buy the shoes. Many of them, waited outside of footlockers for eight hours to buy the limited shoes, and some of them paid higher price to buy the shoes from other resellers. Based on this big consumerism, sneaker “slaves” keep stimulating shoe companies to produce more products, and this vicious cycle finally caused some issues such as pollutions, and wasted of recourses. Therefore, we must find out some solutions to fix and avoid such issues to protect our nature.</p>
