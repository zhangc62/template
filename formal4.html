			<p style="font-family:Courier;color:black;">In short, the discipline chemistry is used wildly in this world; it covers many subjects and knowledge. For example, an interview made with an interior design major student, whom named Kyle. From the interview, Kyle basically reveals the relationship between his discipline and chemistry, he states that between art and chemistry there are a lot of similar roots, because arts are founded from our lives, feelings, and chemistry are also appeared in our surroundings. Therefore, there are so many similarities between these two related disciplines.
				Shortly, chemistry really changes our lives, it is a very common knowledge in the world, but it also is most miraculous in the universe. People starting explore chemistry from ancient until modern, from daily lives, surroundings to the entire universe. According to an interview with one of my chemistry teachers, in chemistry fields she reflects that there are many unknown areas that people still need to explore, such as some new kind of green energy to instant of petroleum; moreover, she also said that nowadays people already made some improvements on recyclable energy to deal with climate change and energy consumption problems, in fact, we are still facing some serious issues today, for example, the hole of ozone and global warming. Therefore, peopleâ€™s journey in chemistry fields is still challenging and uncharted.</p>
